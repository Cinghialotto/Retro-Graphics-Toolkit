/* Subsystem declarations
 * Subsystem as the name implies depends on which system is selected
 * These are not compatible when switching systems
 * For the Sega Genesis, Master System and Game Gear bits 1-0 contain bit depth 0 means 1 bit
 * For the Sega Genesis bit 2 sets if shadow highlight is enabled and bit 3 sets if highlight should be displayed instead of shadow
 * For the Sega Genesis bit 5-3 contain which palette table is used.
 * For the NES bit 1 contains bit depth 1 if 2 bit 0 if 1 bit
 * For the TMS9918 bits 1-0 contain the subsystem
 * For palette framebuffer bits 2-0 contain bit depth add 1 to get actual just like the others
 * Bits 6-2 contain screen depth for example if set to 15 (16 remember always +1) that would mean palette is based on rgb565 colors
 * For framebuffer bits 4-0 contain bit depth again remember to add one to get actual bit depth
 * Valid values are
 * 0 - 1 bit black and white
 * 14 - rgb555
 * 15 - rgb565
 * 23 - rgb888
 * 31 - rgba 8888
 * Bit 4 specifies order this depends on bit depth
 * When 15 or 16`specifies byte swapping
 * When 24 bit or 32 stores as bgr or rgb
 * if bit depth is 32 bit then bit 5 is used to determine if alpha value should be before or after rgb/bgr
