This example uses https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS .
I decided not to include the library because it may be updated and I may not be
aware of this. I do not want to host an old version of the library. To compile
just place SMSlib.c and SMSlib.h in this folder, run make and it will compile
provided that you have installed SDCC.

Note: I could not compile devkitSMS without modifying it. I needed to add:
#include <stdbool.h>
to SMSlib.h

This was with the latest snapshot of SDCC and devkitSMS. For SDCC it is 3.5.2
#9277. For SMSlib it is commit 33fac1a314e07d807e6b9588592de969e687b647.

This may change in future revisions. Do not assume the change I propose will
still be needed.
