This example uses https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS. I decided not to include
the library because it may be updated and I may not be aware of this. I do not
want to host an old version of the library. To compile just place SMSlib.c,
SMSlib.h and peep-rules.txt in this folder, run make and it will compile
provided that you have installed SDCC.
