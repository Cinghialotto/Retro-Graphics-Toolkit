If you are a windows user and want to build this you will need mingw.
First of all in the Retro Graphics Toolkit directory create a folder called lua
Then extract all files from the src folder into the folder you just created.
Then rename all *.c files to *.cpp
HINT: Don't do this manually on *unix you can just run:
rename .c .cpp *.c
The reason lua is built even though many distributions already provide lua is so that the latest version is used and so that this version which may be built with a different configuration does not overwrite your system's instillation of lua.
(Windows only on other systems your distribution of choice should already have provided fltk) you will now need to build fltk to do this download fltk-1.3.2 and extract it into the Retro Graphics Toolkit project folder and build it using
either ./configure if you are on windows or if you are cross compiling you need to something like this ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Regardless of how ./configure is ran you will just need to run make and you are done building fltk.

Now on linux run make or on windows run make -f make_win note that you may need to modify the CXX and CC variables if on windows.

You should now have a compiled version of Retro Graphics Toolkit.
