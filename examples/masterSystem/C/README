This example uses https://github.com/sverx/devkitSMS .
I decided not to include the library because it may be updated and I may not be
aware of this. I do not want to host an old version of the library. To compile
just place SMSlib.c and SMSlib.h in this folder, run make and it will compile
provided that you have installed SDCC.
