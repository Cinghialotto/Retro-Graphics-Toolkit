Retro Graphics Toolkit is a program that makes editing palette based tiles easy.
It can do.
Duplicate tile removing with h-flip v-flip and vh-flip
It can automaticly generate an optimal palette
It can save to both NES and sega genesis format
And much more
To compile this make sure you have fltk installed (on binary based distro maybe use dev package) then type make and it should compile
If you don't want to do that I will get binaries up evetuly but they won't be hosted on github
