This details how the auto generated bindings were made.

First setup dub with these instructions:
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/lubyk/dub
cd dub
luarocks --local  make ./dub-2.2.5-1.rockspec
eval $(luarocks path --bin)
# In the Retro Graphics Toolkit directory
cd makeBindings
# If you try and build a binding for the entire FLTK library you will errors. Do this instead:
mkdir -p FL
cp ../fltk-1.3.4-2/FL/Fl_Shared_Image.H FL/
lua mkFLTKbind.lua
# Now post process the generated bindings.
python3 postProcessFL.py
After this add the *.cpp and *.h files to the autogeneratedBindings folder then modify the code using addlib.c and includes.h as a guide.
