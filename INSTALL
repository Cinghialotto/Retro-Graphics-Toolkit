If you are a windows user and want to build this you will need mingw.

First of all in the Retro Graphics Toolkit directory create a folder called lua or luawin on windows.
Note the only reason for creating a separate folder is to accommodate for the fact that I do all my development on GNU/Linux and have a separate instillation of GCC as a cross compiler. This allows me to quickly test the windows build and *unix build simultaneously.
Extract the latest version of Lua in the newly created folder.
Now edit the makefile in src
edit CC=gcc to say CC=g++
If you are using a cross compiler make sure to take into account it's prefix also you will need to modify the AR and RANLIB variables if such is the case.
Also if you are building on windows you must replace this line in the Makefile
	"AR=$(CC) -shared -o" "RANLIB=strip --strip-unneeded" \
with
	"AR=$(CC) -shared -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -o" "RANLIB=strip --strip-all" \
Lua can be build using c++ which is what we are doing this is to take advantage of GCC's support for zero cost exception handling using throw.
The reason Lua is built even though many distributions already provide Lua is so that the latest version is used and so that this version which may be built with a different configuration does not overwrite your system's instillation of Lua.
Now run make linux or make mingw depending on your system platform.
DO NOT RUN MAKE INSTALL.

(Windows only. On other systems your distribution of choice should already have provided fltk) you will now need to build fltk to do this download fltk-1.3.2 and extract it into the Retro Graphics Toolkit project folder and build it using
either ./configure if you are on windows or if you are cross compiling you need to something like this ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32 --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Regardless of how ./configure is ran you will just need to run make and you are done building fltk.

Now on linux run make or on windows run make -f make_win note that you may need to modify the CXX and CC variables if on windows.

You should now have a compiled version of Retro Graphics Toolkit.
